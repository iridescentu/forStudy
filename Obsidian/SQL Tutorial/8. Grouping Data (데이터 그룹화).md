- **GROUP BY**
```sql
SELECT 
    department_id
FROM 
    employees
GROUP BY 
    department_id;



# DISTINCT
SELECT 
   DISTINCT department_id
FROM 
   employees
ORDER BY 
   department_id;



# 함수와 함께
SELECT
	department_id,
	COUNT(employee_id) headcount
FROM
	employees
GROUP BY
	department_id;


SELECT 
    department_name,
    MIN(salary) min_salary,
    MAX(salary) max_salary,
    ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) average_salary
FROM
    employees e
        INNER JOIN
    departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY 
    department_name;


SELECT 
    department_name,
    SUM(salary) total_salary
FROM
    employees e
        INNER JOIN
    departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY 
    department_name;




# JOIN
SELECT
	department_name,
	COUNT(employee_id) headcount
FROM
	employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY
        department_name;




# HAVING
SELECT 
    department_name,
    COUNT(employee_id) headcount
FROM
    employees e
        INNER JOIN
    departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY department_name
HAVING headcount > 5
ORDER BY headcount DESC;



# 여러개의 열로 그룹화
SELECT 
    department_name,
    job_title,
    COUNT(employee_id)
FROM
    employees e
        INNER JOIN
    departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
        INNER JOIN
    jobs j ON j.job_id = e.job_id
GROUP BY department_name , 
         job_title;
```

- **HAVING**
	* WHERE vs HAVING
	* WHERE 는 GROUP BY 에 의해 행이 그룹으로 요약되기 전에 개별 행에 조건을 적용.
	* HAVING 은 행이 그룹으로 그룹화된 후 그룹에 조건을 적용.
	⇒ HAVING 절은 뒤에 적용되고 WHERE 절은 GROUP BY 절 앞에 적용된다는 점에 유의!!!
```sql
# WHERE
SELECT 
    manager_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    COUNT(employee_id) direct_reports
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    manager_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY manager_id;




# HAVING
SELECT 
    manager_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    COUNT(employee_id) direct_reports
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    manager_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY manager_id
HAVING direct_reports >= 5;




# SUM
SELECT 
    department_id, SUM(salary)
FROM
    employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING SUM(salary) BETWEEN 20000 AND 30000
ORDER BY SUM(salary);




# MIN
SELECT
	e.department_id,
	department_name,
	MIN(salary)
FROM
	employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY
	e.department_id
HAVING
	MIN(salary) >= 10000
ORDER BY
	MIN(salary);




# AVG
SELECT
	e.department_id,
	department_name,
	ROUND(AVG(salary), 2)
FROM
	employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY
	e.department_id
HAVING
	AVG(salary) BETWEEN 5000
AND 7000
ORDER BY
	AVG(salary);
```

- **ROLLUP**
	* 계층적인 총계 및 소계를 생성하여 데이터를 요약
```sql
SELECT 
    warehouse, SUM(quantity)
FROM
    inventory
GROUP BY warehouse;
// ROLLUP을 쓰지 않은 코드



# ROLLUP
SELECT 
    warehouse, SUM(quantity)
FROM
    inventory
GROUP BY warehouse WITH ROLLUP;

SELECT 
    COALESCE(warehouse, 'All warehouses') AS warehouse,
    SUM(quantity)
FROM
    inventory
GROUP BY warehouse WITH ROLLUP;




# 여러 열의 ROLLUP
SELECT 
    warehouse, product, SUM(quantity)
FROM
    inventory
GROUP BY warehouse, product WITH ROLLUP;
```
