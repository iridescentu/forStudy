- AVG == average
```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(salary)
FROM
    employees;

SELECT 
    department_name, ROUND(AVG(salary), 0) avg_salary
FROM
    employees
        INNER JOIN
    departments USING (department_id)
GROUP BY department_name
ORDER BY department_name;
```


- MIN (DISTINCT 옵션은 적용되지 않음) == minimum
```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(salary)
FROM
    employees;

SELECT 
    department_name, MIN(salary) min_salary
FROM
    employees
        INNER JOIN
    departments USING (department_id)
GROUP BY department_name
ORDER BY department_name;
```


- MAX (DISTINCT 옵션은 적용되지 않음) == maximum
```sql
SELECT 
    MAX(salary)
FROM
    employees;

SELECT 
    department_name, MAX(salary) highest_salary
FROM
    employees
        INNER JOIN
    departments USING (department_id)
GROUP BY department_name
ORDER BY department_name;
```


- COUNT
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    employees;


SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    department_id = 6;



# group by
SELECT 
    department_name, COUNT(*) headcount // 별명 붙일 때 as 붙이는 것처럼 COUNT 뒤에 headcount를 붙이면 column 이름이 headcount가 됨. 이 경우 headcount를 빼면 COUNT(*)가 column의 이름이 된다
FROM
    employees
        INNER JOIN
    departments USING (department_id)
GROUP BY department_name
ORDER BY department_name;



# order by
SELECT
	e.department_id,
	department_name,
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY
	e.department_id
ORDER BY
	COUNT(*) DESC;



# DISTINCT를 사용할때와 아닐때의 차이
SELECT 
    COUNT(job_id)
FROM
    employees;


SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) // job_id에 distinct를 붙임으로써 job_id가 제외된 값이 표시된다
FROM
    employees;
```


- SUM
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(salary)
FROM
    employees;

SELECT 
    department_id, SUM(salary)
FROM
    employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```
